Tracking voiceover sound banks (.bnk files) involves monitoring the files to observe how audio is incorporated into characters, allowing for predictions on when new lines are added. This process likely entails examining the structure of these files, identifying patterns or changes indicative of updates, and possibly using tools or software to analyze and interpret the content within the files. By studying these sound banks, one can gain insights into the progression of voiceover work for characters, aiding in forecasting future additions or modifications to dialogue.
